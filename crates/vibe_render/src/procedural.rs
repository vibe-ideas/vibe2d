//! Procedurally generated textures.
//!
//! These are runtime-generated images (a 1×1 white pixel, an antialiased
//! filled disc, a hollow ring, …) that the engine and games use as
//! drawable atoms — typically tinted at draw time. Kept in their own
//! module rather than mixed into `renderer.rs` so the renderer file
//! stays focused on the render-pipeline / batching / screenshot path,
//! and so the pure CPU pixel rasterizers can be unit-tested without
//! standing up a `Renderer`.
//!
//! Layering:
//! - `build_*_pixels`  — pure CPU; produce row-major RGBA8 buffers.
//! - `Renderer::create_*_texture` (in this file's `impl Renderer` block)
//!   — glue the CPU buffers to a GPU upload via `create_rgba_texture`.
//! - `create_rgba_texture` — the single point of contact with wgpu for
//!   "give me a sampled texture from this RGBA buffer". Reused by every
//!   procedural-texture helper here, and exposed publicly so games can
//!   roll their own (gradients, particle masks, …) without re-deriving
//!   the bind-group plumbing.

// width because alias width in *pixels* is what matters for the eye, not
// alias width in % of the disc. Both pixel buffers are returned in
