//! AOI demo — three independently-moving circles observe a shared
//! field of static scatter points. Any point covered by *any* circle
//! lights up green; points fade back to gray when no circle covers
//! them anymore.
//!
//! Drives the entire demo with `vibe_aoi`:
//! - Scatter entities come in two flavors:
//!   - **Round dots** — `Shape::Circle`, **participate** in the lit/dim
//!     coverage logic. These are what the observer filter accepts.
//!   - **Square dots** — `Shape::Aabb`, **never light up**. They exist
//!     to demonstrate type filtering: every observer's `AoiFilter`
//!     rejects them, so they stay gray no matter which observer ring
//!     passes over them. This mirrors a real game where, e.g., decoy
//!     props are inside the AOI broadphase but irrelevant to gameplay.
//! - Each moving circle is an **observer region** (not an entity)
//!   carrying a persistent `AoiFilter`. The filter does two jobs:
//!   1. **Type filter** — `kind == Round` (squares always rejected).
//!   2. **Distance LOD** (toggled with `[L]`) — drop round dots whose
//!      center is more than `LOD_RADIUS` away from the observer center.
//!      Models the "don't replicate to clients beyond LOD distance"
//!      pattern in networked games. With `LOD_RADIUS == CIRCLE_RADIUS`
//!      this is a no-op, so the LOD lever is set to `< CIRCLE_RADIUS`
//!      and you can watch the lit set shrink when LOD is on.
//! - Wall collision is plain business logic (flip the velocity vector
//!   on the appropriate axis); we explicitly do *not* use a physics
//!   engine here, since the design doc draws the AOI/physics boundary
//!   at "AOI tells you who's nearby, physics tells you what to do
//!   about it".
//!
//! Visual treatment:
//! - Observer circles are rendered as **transparent rings** via
//!   `Screen::draw_circle_outline`. Round dots underneath stay visible.
//! - Round dots use `Screen::draw_circle`; square dots are drawn as
//!   actual axis-aligned squares using the engine's white-pixel
//!   texture so they're trivially distinguishable from rounds at a
//!   glance.
//! - The stats panel is built with `vibe_ui` (panel + labels) so it
//!   composites on top of the world via the engine's UI pipeline
//!   instead of getting baked into the world layer.
//!
//! VDP wiring lives in [`AoiDemo::handle_vdp`], which forwards anything
//! starting with `aoi.` to `vibe_aoi::AoiWorld::handle_vdp` and exposes
//! a small custom `demo.*` namespace for inspection from the test
//! suite.
